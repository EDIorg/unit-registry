## Synchronization with EML-2.2
This database has been kept synchronized with versions of the unitDictionary.xml in EML, using the scope field. Therefore, it was logical to use this DB for 
examining potential additions to the EML2.2 unit dictionary. E.g., this DB already allows units to be deprecated (in favor of another), a feature we needed 
EML 2.2

This directory holds files specifically for working with EML 2.2.

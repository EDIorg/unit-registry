## progress
1. deprecated the duplicates.
1. dumped the DB after (see archive)
1. moving on to quantity, which in STMML, ends up in the unitType. It causes a lot of confusion. I think the quantityExpression table is trying to do too much.


## exploring use of quantity expressions.


sql: 
```
SELECT q.name AS "Quantity", b.name AS "Base unit", ex.power 
FROM quantityExpression ex, baseQuantity b, quantity q
WHERE ex.quantityId = q.quantityId and ex.baseQuantityId = b.baseQuantityId
ORDER BY q.name asc, ex.power desc
```
see db_exports/select_quantity_baseUnit_power.csv
 

## quantities:
Some are pretty straightforward, and have only one set of dimensions. but for some, it's a many:many 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration#Table_of_concentrations_and_related_quantities

one of wiki's refs (in statement that 'related quants', eg, mass fractions, are NOT concentrations).
http://goldbook.iupac.org/html/C/C01222.html

Others, a single unit actually may be used by several different quantities; but that are derived differently.
the deriviation (or other complex description) does not belong in a unit dictionary. but example usage would be helpful

## wacky units and quantities:
some quantities are just plain wrong. explore how they got there for patterns.

sql for every unit, its quantity and scope: 
```
SELECT q.name AS 'Quantity', u.name AS 'Unit', s.name AS 'Scope'  
FROM   quantity q, unit u, scope s, unitScope us
WHERE ( u.quantityId = q.quantityId and us.ScopeId = s.scopeId and us.unitId = u.unitId )
-- AND u.deprecatedTo IS NULL 
-- ORDER BY q.name asc, ex.power desc
```



sql for scopes that have contributed units, and how many:
```
SELECT  s.name AS 'Scope'  , count(*)
FROM   scope s, unitScope us
WHERE ( us.ScopeId = s.scopeId )
GROUP BY s.name
ORDER BY s.name
```

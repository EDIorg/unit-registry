Bottom line: SI can't do it all. there are plenty of quantities (where 'quantity' = a property that can be measured), which are legitimately outside of SI, but we expect to be able to wedge them in. 

Also, in these articles, authors' examples exhibit issues similar to what we have when modeling complex measurements -- there are important concepts in their deriviation (or methodology or expression), and these don't fit into simple models.

  - suggested fixes to SI, particularly for angular, counting measurements.

Bryanskii LN, AS Doinikov, BN Krupin. 1999. General Topics in Metrology and Measurement Technology
  - I like table 1: a whole page of absolute quantities ("dimensionless"), with measurement units, notations, fractions etc.

Bottom line: SI can't do it all. there are plenty of 'units' which are legitimately outside of SI, but we are trying to kludge them in.

Mohr PJ and WD Philips. 2015. Dimensionless Units in the SI
  - suggested fixes to SI, particularly for angular, counting measurements.

Bryanskii LN, AS Doinikov, BN Krupin. 1999. General Topics in Metrology and Measurement Technology
  - I like table 1: a whole page of absolute quantities ("dimensionless"), measurement units, notations, fractions etc.
